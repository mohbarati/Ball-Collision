all the collios# Ball-Collision
Ball collision against an arbitrary force field 
Most collision simulations I encountered so far, were head-on solutions to the problem of elastic collision.
I will try to simulate it for a more general case in two and then higher dimensions.
elasticity and other features of the collisions (e.g. mass, size, gravitational pull...etc. ) should be accounted for.

The code here is mearly the body and will change when i figured out how to use more complicated python tools!

What this code does is showing a simple head-on collision when the masses are equal and the collisions are always elastic.
Note: No field of any kind is applied.
